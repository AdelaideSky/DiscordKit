# DiscordKit

The Discord API implementation that powers [Swiftcord](https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/Swiftcord)

This implementation has fully functional REST and Gateway
support, but is mainly geared towards human accounts and not bots.

**If you like DiscordKit, please give it a ‚≠ê star! It helps motivate
me to continue developing it**

## Check out [Swiftcord](https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/Swiftcord) for an example of a project that uses DiscordKit!

### Join the Swiftcord Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/he7n6MGDXS)!

### WIP Developer Documentation is available [here](https://swiftcordapp.github.io/DiscordKit/documentation/discordkit/).

## Platform Support

Currently, DiscordKit only offically supports macOS versions 12 and up. Theoretically, You should be able to compile and use DiscordKit on i(Pad)OS/tvOS, however this has not been tested and is considered an unsupported setup.

Linux and Windows is not supported at the moment, due to our reliance on Apple's `Security` and `SystemConfiguration` frameworks. We have not blocked building DiscordKit on Linux and Windows in the event that support for those frameworks is added in the future. We may rework the code to add support for linux/windows in the future.

## Adding DiscordKit to your project
### SPM:
Add the following to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/DiscordKit", branch: "main"),
```
Currently, DiscordKit is in alpha, so it's recommended to use the latest commit on the `main` branch.
